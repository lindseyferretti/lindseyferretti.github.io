The rise of AI has led to a rapid increase in [published research](https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions), and this trend is only accelerating. In an attempt to stay informed, I'll be posting brief paper summaries with key takeaways and any questions or topics I want to dig into further. All posts will be listed under the [Paper Reviews](/categories/paper-reviews/) category. I’ll also keep adding to the backlog here as I find more interesting stuff. I’m sure this page will become quite the behemoth in no time.
