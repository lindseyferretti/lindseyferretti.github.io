I’ve always loved learning and exploring new ideas. As a kid I’d spend hours in front of the TV with a notebook, conducting my own “research” (scribbling notes together while watching the Discovery Channel). Now with digital text it’s so much easier to find and organize ideas, which is why I’m creating this space to keep track of what’s inspiring me. I might even dust off some old writings hidden in random text files scattered across my desktop.

If you're looking for my work history, you can head over to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindseyferretti).

I'm also on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cogqueries.bsky.social), mainly reposting interesting research and AI news. 

Lastly, if you're at all interested in Generative AI, Robotics, Security (or just about any similar discipline) and want to surround yourself with others that share the same passion for learning, I can't recommend [the Multiverse School](https://themultiverse.school/) enough. The [AI & Coffee](https://themultiverse.school/x/programs) sessions run by [Chris](https://thecoffeejesus.com/) are a great place to start. If you have any questions feel free to shoot me an email and I can connect you with the right folks.
