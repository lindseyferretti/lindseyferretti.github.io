As a kid I’d spend hours in front of the TV with a notebook conducting my own “research”, furiously scribbling notes while watching the Discovery Channel. These days, digital text makes it easier to find and organize ideas, but now my browser is perpetually overflowing with open tabs and links I swear I’ll read later (we all do this, right?). So I’m creating this space to help me collect notes and ideas in a place I can actually find them again.
