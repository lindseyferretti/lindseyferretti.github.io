| AI                   | Artificial Intelligence, the simulation of human intelligence by machines.                                  | Virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa that can answer questions and perform tasks. |
| Algorithm            | A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem.                                                  | A recipe for baking a cake, where each step leads to the final product. |
| API                  | Short for Application Programming Interface, a set of rules that allows software programs to communicate.   | When you use an app to check the weather, it gets the data from a weather service through an API. |
| Dataset              | A collection of data used for training or testing machine learning models.                                  | A photo album of cats and dogs that a computer learns to tell them apart. |
| LLM                  | Stands for Large Language Model, an AI trained on vast amounts of text data for tasks like text generation. | ChatGPT, which can write essays, answer questions, and have conversations. |
| Machine Learning     | A subset of AI that enables computers to learn and make decisions without explicit programming.             | A music app learning what songs you like and suggesting similar ones. |
| Model                | In AI, a mathematical representation of a process or task trained on data to make predictions or decisions. | A spam filter that learns to recognize unwanted emails based on examples of spam and non-spam. |
| Neural Network       | A series of algorithms modeled after the human brain, used to recognize patterns in data.                   | How a computer learns to recognize your face in a photo app. |
| Open Source          | Software whose source code is publicly available for anyone to view, modify, or distribute.                 | Wikipedia is like open-source software: anyone can edit and improve it. |
| Prompt Engineering   | The practice of crafting inputs to improve responses from AI models like chatbots or LLMs.                  | Writing "Summarize this in 3 points" to get a clear summary from a chatbot. |
| Token                | A unit of text (like a word or character) that AI models process during language tasks.                     | Breaking a sentence like "I love pie" into parts like "I," "love," and "pie" so the computer can understand it. |
| Training             | The process of teaching a machine learning model to make predictions by feeding it data.                    | Showing a computer thousands of photos of flowers so it can learn to identify different types. |
